					<p>A git repository for this very web site. As I am at all times
						constantly trying to tinker with this website for learning
						purposes, I have opted to put my software onto GitHub
						so that I may have a repository that I am able to remotely save to
						and pull from.</p>

						<p>I will admit that my work is very likely full of errors, but I am
							mainly self taught in the actual way of programming and web design.
							I also may be spoiled by IDE's that are very good at making sure
							indentation is right.</p>

					<p>This website is a project built through a series of free videos that teaches viewers how to create a website using Ruby on Rails,
						Bootstrap, and many other tools.</p>
					<p>This website is somewhat based on what I learned taking this course to whatever degree.</p>
					<p>It is important to note that my work on this project is not finished as I have not completeted the course,
						however there was quite the learning experience to be had and I would recommend anyone with the free time
						to take a look into this course if they wish to gain more insight into web development.</p>
